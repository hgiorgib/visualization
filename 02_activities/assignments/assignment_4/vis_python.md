# Short Term Rentals in Toronto: Python Visualization

## Visualization Overview

This bar plot illustrates the distribution of short-term rental properties across Torontoâ€™s wards, focusing on the top 10 wards with the highest number of registered properties. The data was grouped by ward_name, and the number of properties was calculated by counting entries within each ward. The resulting chart provides a clear view of the areas with the most active short-term rental registrations.

## Dataset Description

The dataset, titled Short Term Rentals Registration, includes details on short-term rental operator registration numbers issued by the City of Toronto. It is refreshed daily and provides comprehensive insights into active registrations, covering attributes such as addresses, postal codes, property types, and ward information.
