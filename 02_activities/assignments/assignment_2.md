# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  

### Good Visualization

    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...

      *  It takes advantage of the emotions evoked by recalling the evolution of the iMac, which has been a part of households for decades. The target audience for this visualization appears to be the general public, and regardless of age, it is likely that most people remember at least one of the very popular iMac versions.

      * The visualization cleverly uses a timeline, marked in years, by linking it with images that show the evolution of the iMac's screen thickness.

      * Similarly, for the power consumption evolution, the visualization uses power meters to quickly convey the visual inference that todayâ€™s iMac consumes 97% less electricity than the first iMac. This innovatives ideas of how to present the information reduce a lot the cognitive load.

      * It leverages providence rhetoric to convey trustworthiness, effectively highlighting the significant reduction in power consumption and the technological evolution in design and size. Using minimal text and carefully selected images, the visualization clearly communicates its message with simplicity and impact.
      

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...

      * The text in the visualization is very small, and the combination of font attributes and text placement is not ideal, making it difficult to read. Using a larger text size, a more suitable font color and type, and better placement can improve readability and ensure the message is conveyed more effectively.

      * The visualization lacks a title. Adding a title would help the audience quickly understand the context of the visualization.
            
      ```


### Bad Visualization

    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...

      * The visualization imposes a high cognitive load, with an overwhelming amount of text, numbers, names, and abbreviations that viewers must process.

      * The text is hard to read due to the very small font size and the large amount of text concentrated in one half of the visualization.

      * The dimensions or units of the graph axis are not clearly defined, making it difficult to understand the message of the graph. Combined with the massive amount of text, this may lead viewers to abandon the visualization.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...

      * Redesign the graph to better convey the essence of the visualization's message.
     
      * It would be better to significantly reduce the amount of text and utilize more visual tools to convey the information, minimizing the cognitive load on viewers.
               
      ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
